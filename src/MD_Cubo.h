LED Cubes
---------

The MD_Cubo library implements methods and a framework that enable the software elements of 
any monochrome or color LED cube to be easily implemented. This allows the programmer to 
use the LED matrix as a voxel device addressable through XYZ cartesian coordinates, displaying 
graphics elements much like any other voxel addressable display.

The Library
-----------
The library implements functions that allow LED cubes to be abstracted in software so that 
underlying hardware changes do not affect the definition and structure of the controlling code.

In this scenario, it is convenient to abstract out the concept of the hardware device and 
create a uniform and consistent 3D cartesian (XYZ) voxel address space, with the libraries 
determining device-element address for each LED. Similarly, control of the devices should 
be uniform and abstracted to a system level.

There appears to be 2 major architectures for implementing cubes:

-# A 'scanning refresh' model. In this model the LEDs are refreshed by the Arduino at a rate fast 
enough to activate a persistence of vision (POV) effect.
-# A 'set and forget' model. In this model the voxel is set by the Arduino and some other hardware 
ensures that the appropriate LEDs are turned on.

The software must take into account these differences and allow both to work using the same basic 
software pattern. At a fundamental level, the hardware dependent code required needs to do the following:
- Initialize the hardware
- Turn on specific LED (voxel) on or off in the specified color
- Update the display (internal buffers to actual device)
- Animate the display (ignored for 'set and forget', refresh for scanning)

The standard library supports several different types of cubes, listed below. To 
add a new type of hardware architecture, refer to \subpage pageAddHardware

A word about Axes
-----------------
To enable user code to work properly a convention related to the orientation of the XYZ axes needs 
to be implemented in the hardware dependent code. 

Decide on a 'bottom' corner to be the origin (0,0,0). This will usually be one of the corners just 
above the supporting PCB. Orient the cube so one face of the cube is directly towards you and the 
origin is located in the lower left hand corner.

![MD_Cubo Axes Convention] (MD_Cubo_Axes.jpg "MD_Cubo Axes Convention")

From this reference point
- the Z axis is the vertical axis up the cube.
- the Y axis is the left to right axis you can see.
- the X axis is the axis in the 'depth' direction of the cube.
